# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Overview
Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Image Classification project! In this repository, we delve into the fascinating realm of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark in the field of computer vision, serves as our playground. Our primary objective is to build and evaluate CNN-based models capable of accurately classifying images across ten distinct categories.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision owing to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical patterns and features from raw image data. Unlike traditional fully connected neural networks, CNNs are specifically designed to handle the spatial structure of images. They consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply filters to input images to extract features such as edges, textures, and shapes. Pooling layers then downsample the feature maps to reduce computational complexity and extract the most salient features. Finally, fully connected layers aggregate these features for classification.

## CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images, each belonging to one of ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. It is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms due to its moderate size and complexity. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each class containing an equal number of samples. These images are relatively low-resolution, posing a challenge for classification algorithms to discern intricate details.

## Experimental Approach
Our experimental approach involves implementing various CNN architectures and training them on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We explore different network depths, filter sizes, activation functions, and regularization techniques to optimize model performance. Following training, we evaluate the models on the test set and analyze their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize the learned features and misclassified images to gain insights into the strengths and limitations of each model.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different configurations, and contribute to the advancement of image classification techniques!
